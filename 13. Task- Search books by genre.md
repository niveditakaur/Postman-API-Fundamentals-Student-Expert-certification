### Steps:

2. **Add Query Parameter**:
- In the duplicated request, navigate to the Params tab.
- Add a query parameter with key "genre" and value "fiction" to filter for fiction books.
- Postman automatically syncs the request URL, adding the "?" to indicate the start of query parameters.

3. **Save and Send Request**:
- Save the modified request.
- Send the request.

4. **Verify Response**:
- Upon sending the request, expect a 200 OK response.
- The response will contain an array of book objects, but only those with the fiction genre.

### Additional Options:
- You can experiment with different values for the "genre" query parameter to filter for other genres.
- Remember to save your request after making any modifications.
