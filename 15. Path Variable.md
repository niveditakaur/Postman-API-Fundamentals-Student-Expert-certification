# Path Variable

## Definition
- Path variable (or path parameter) is a dynamic section of a URL path, often used for IDs and entity names.

## Syntax
- Path variables come immediately after a slash in the URL path.
- Example: `GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}`

## Usage
- Allows passing dynamic values in the URL path.
- Can have multiple path variables in a single request.
- Example: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}`

## Comparison with Query Parameters
| Path Variable                  | Query Parameters                        |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Located directly after a slash | Located only at the end of a path       |
| Can be anywhere on the path     | Located right after a question mark (?) |
| Accepts dynamic values          | Accepts defined keys with dynamic values|
| Often used for IDs or entity names | Often used for options and filters    |

- Note: These are conventions; some APIs might use query parameters for IDs or usernames.

## When to Use Path Variables
- Always refer to API documentation to determine if path parameters are required.
- Some APIs use colon syntax (e.g., `/users/:username`), while others use curly braces (e.g., `/users/{username}`). Both denote dynamic parts of the path.
