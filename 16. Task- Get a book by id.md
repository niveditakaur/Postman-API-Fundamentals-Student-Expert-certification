# Task: Get a book by id

## Overview
- To retrieve a specific book from the library's collection, we can use the GET method with the path `/books/:id`, where `:id` represents the unique identifier of the book.
- The unique identifier allows us to access the book's information even if other properties change.

## Steps:

1. **Create a new request in Postman:**
- Click on the three dots icon in the Postman Library API v2 Collection.
- Select "Add request" and name it "Get book by id".
- Set the request method to GET.

2. **Set up the request URL:**
- Paste the endpoint `{{baseUrl}}/books/:id` as the request URL.
- Postman automatically adds a "Path Variables" editor in the Params tab for path variables.

3. **Provide the book's id as a path variable:**
- In the Params tab, paste the id for the book "Ficciones" (`29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89`) as the value for the path variable named `id`.
- Ensure there are no whitespaces around the id value.

4. **Save the request.**

5. **Send the request:**
- Click on the "Send" button.
- Expect a 200 OK response with a single JSON object representing the "Ficciones" book, indicating it is not checked out.

## Debugging requests in Postman Console:
- The Postman Console, located in the lower left of Postman, logs all requests and responses.
- Check the console for any errors or unexpected behavior.
- Ensure the raw request is sent as expected, especially with query and path parameter values.
- Postman replaces the `:id` placeholder with the actual book id when making the request.
