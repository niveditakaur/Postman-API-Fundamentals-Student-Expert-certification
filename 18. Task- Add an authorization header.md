# Task: Add an Authorization Header

## Authorization
- APIs may require authorization for certain endpoints to control access.
- Open endpoints could lead to unauthorized access or overload from bots.

### Methods for Authorization
- Basic Auth: Username and password.
- OAuth: Delegated authorization.
- API Keys: Secret strings registered to a developer.

## Getting an API Key
- APIs using API Key auth often provide keys via a developer portal.
- Keys track usage and identify callers.
- Example: Postman Library API v2:
  - Header name: api-key
  - Header value: postmanrulz
  - Required for requests altering database data.

## Headers
- Headers convey metadata like authorization or desired response data type.
- Analogous to envelope details when sending a letter.
- Separate from request payload (e.g., new book information).

## Adding API Key to Request Header
1. Navigate to the "add a book" request and select the Headers tab.
2. Add the key "api-key" with a value of "postmanrulz" in the Headers helper table.
3. Save and send the request.
- Upon success, expect a 201 Created response with additional book details.

### Success Confirmation
- Upon successful authorization, a 201 Created response is expected.
- Newly added book will have a unique ID, checkout status, and creation timestamp.

## View New Book (Optional)
- Use the received book ID to fetch its details.
- Update the "get books by id" request with the new ID value.

### Conclusion
- Proper authorization ensures secure access to API endpoints.
- Postman provides an intuitive interface for managing headers and authorization.
