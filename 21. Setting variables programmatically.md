# Setting Variables Programmatically in Postman

## Introduction to Scripting in Postman
- Postman allows adding automation and dynamic behaviors to collections with scripting.
- Scripts are executed during two events: before a request is sent (pre-request script) and after a response comes back (test script).

## Using the pm Object
- Postman provides a helper object named `pm` to access data about the environment, requests, responses, variables, and testing utilities.
- Example: Accessing the JSON response body from an API: `pm.response.json()`.
- Example: Getting collection variables like the value of `baseUrl`: `pm.collectionVariables.get("baseUrl")`.
- Example: Setting collection variables programmatically: `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", "variableValue")`.
