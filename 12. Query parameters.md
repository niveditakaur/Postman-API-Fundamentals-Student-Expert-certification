# Query Parameters

## Overview
- Query parameters are key-value pairs added to the end of the URL to refine a request.
- They provide additional information to the server for processing the request.

## Syntax
- Query parameters start with a question mark (?), followed by key-value pairs: `<key>=<value>`.
- Multiple query parameters are separated by an ampersand (&).

## Example
- Fetching photos with a specific orientation:
  - `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape`
- Fetching photos with specific orientation and size:
  - `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500x400`

## Usage
- Query parameters are used to filter, sort, or customize responses from APIs.
- They can be optional or required depending on the API's implementation.
- Always refer to the API documentation to understand the usage and requirements of query parameters.

## Example: Google Search
- Searching on Google with query parameters:
  - Example URL: `https://www.google.com/search?q=postman`
  - Here, `q=postman` specifies the search term "postman".
