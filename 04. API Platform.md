# Postman: An API Platform

Postman is an API platform designed for building and utilizing APIs. It simplifies each stage of the API lifecycle and facilitates collaboration, enabling users to create and consume APIs more efficiently. With over 25 million users worldwide, Postman is a trusted tool in the API development community.

## Working with APIs: cURL vs. Postman

### cURL
- Before the advent of Postman, developers commonly interacted with APIs using cURL, a command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
- While effective, cURL has limitations, particularly in terms of collaboration and data visualization.
- Example of an API call using cURL:

curl `https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs`

### Postman
- Postman offers a more user-friendly alternative for working with APIs.
- It provides a graphical interface that displays API responses with clean formatting, including indents and colors.
- Features such as request saving, organization, and sharing enhance collaboration among team members.
- Postman presents all components of the request and response in tabs, along with additional details like response time and status code.
- Example of the same API call done with Postman, showcasing response details in an organized manner.

In summary, while cURL remains a viable option for making API calls, Postman offers a more robust and collaborative approach, making API development and consumption more efficient and user-friendly.
