# Variables in Postman

Postman allows you to save values as variables to reuse them and easily hide sensitive information like API Keys.

## Setting the "baseUrl" Variable

1. Go to the "get books" request in your collection.
2. Select the entire base URL of the API (https://library-api.postmanlabs.com), excluding the trailing slash (/).
3. Click "Set as variable" to save the base URL to a variable.
- Click "Set as a new variable".
- Name your new variable "baseUrl" and select "Collection" as the scope, then click Set variable.

Now that the variable is set, you can access the value anywhere in your collection by typing `{{baseUrl}}`.

## Viewing and Managing Variables

- Hover over {{baseUrl}} to see its current value set to https://library-api.postmanlabs.com.
- To find Collection variables:
  - Click on your collection, then the Variables tab.
  - Here you can view and edit your variables.

### Note:

- Collection variables have two columns:
  - Initial Value: the value initially set when someone forks or imports your collection. It's visible to others if you share your collection.
  - Current Value: Postman resolves the variable to this value, local to your Postman account. It's recommended to keep secrets like API Keys ONLY in this column and not include them in the Initial Value column.
