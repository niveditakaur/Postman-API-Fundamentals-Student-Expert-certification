# Task: Add a Book

As a librarian, adding a new book to the library involves making a POST request with a JSON body to submit book data to the Postman Library API database.

## Understanding the Body

The body data contains structured information that needs to be sent with requests, particularly with PUT, POST, and PATCH requests. It can include various data formats such as JSON, text, JavaScript, HTML, or XML.

## Making a POST Request

1. **Create a New Request:**
- Hover over the Postman Library API v2 Collection.
- Click the three dots icon and select "Add request."
- Name the new request "add book."

2. **Set Request Method and URL:**
- Set the request method to POST.
- Set the request URL to `{{baseUrl}}/books`.

3. **Add Body Data:**
- Click on the "Body" tab.
- Select "raw" as the data type and then choose JSON.
- Inside the Body editor, add a JSON object with details about the new book's title, author, genre, and yearPublished.

Example JSON Object:
```json
{
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "genre": "fiction",
  "yearPublished": 1960
}
