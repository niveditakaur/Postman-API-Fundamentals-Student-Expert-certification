# Your First Script: Basics of JavaScript in Postman

## Logging Data
- Use `console.log()` to print data/values to the console.
  - Example: `console.log("Hello world!")` will print "Hello world!" to the console.

## Comments
- Comments in JavaScript are skipped by the interpreter and are used for explanations.
- Single-line comments start with two slashes (`//`).
  - Example: `// This is a single-line comment`
- Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    /* 
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
    */
    ```

## Adding a Script to a Request
- Modify the data in the request Body to include new book information.
- Open the Tests tab of the request.
- Inside the Tests editor, use JavaScript code to log the JSON response from the API:
  ```javascript
  console.log(pm.response.json())
  ```

## Saving and Running the Request
- Save the request.
- Send the request, which triggers the script in the Tests tab to run after receiving the response from the API.

## Viewing Response Data
- Open the Postman Console located in the lower-left corner of the window.
- Scroll to the bottom of the logs to find the most recent request.
- The response data from the API is logged in the console due to the code in the Tests tab.
