# Task: Use Postman Auth instead!

## Delete the api-key header
- Remove the hard-coded api-key header from the "add a book" request.
- Hover over the api-key header in the Headers tab and click the "x" icon to delete it.
- Save the request.

## Add Auth to the Collection
- Navigate to the collection "Postman Library API v2" and select the Authorization (or Auth) tab.
- Choose API Key as the auth Type.
- Enter the API Key details: Key: api-key, Value: postmanrulz, Add to: Header.
- Save the changes to the collection.

## Add a new book
- Modify the body of the "add a book" request in the Body tab to add another book.
- Ensure the Auth method in the Authorization tab of the request is set to "Inherit from parent" to utilize the API Key set at the collection level.
- Save the request and send it.

### Postman Console 
- Open the Postman Console in the lower left to verify that the API Key has been added as a header (api-key: postmanrulz), indicating authorization.

By following these steps, the API Key authentication is implemented using Postman Auth, ensuring authorized access for requests within the collection.
