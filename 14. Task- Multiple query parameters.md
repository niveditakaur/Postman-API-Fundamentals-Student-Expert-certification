# Task: Multiple Query Parameters

## Objective:
As a librarian, assisting visitors in finding available books (not checked out).

## Steps:
1. **Add Another Query Parameter:**
- Modify the GET request to `/books` to include a second query parameter.
- Ensure that the parameter `checkedOut` is set to `false`.
- This addition filters the response to only include books that are not checked out.

2. **Request Execution:**
- Save the modified request.
- Send the request to the server.

## Expected Outcome:
Upon sending the request:
- Expect a 200 OK response from the server.
- The response should contain an array of fiction books that are not checked out.
- If there are no fiction books available, the response should return an empty array ([]).
