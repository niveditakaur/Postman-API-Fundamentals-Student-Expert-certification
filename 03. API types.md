## Types of APIs
# Medium

### Hardware APIs
- Interface for software to communicate with hardware devices.
- Example: Phone's camera interacting with the operating system.

### Software Library APIs
- Interface for integrating code from external libraries into your application.
- Example: Importing methods from a library to enhance functionality.

### Web APIs
- Interface for exchanging data between different software systems over a network.
- Example: Accessing current stock prices from a finance API online.

Multiple API types can be utilized together for various tasks. For instance, uploading a photo to Instagram involves:

- Using a Hardware API for interacting with the device's camera.
- Leveraging a Software Library API for applying filters to the image.
- Utilizing a Web API to transmit the image to Instagram's servers for sharing.

# Architectures

There are various architecture types for building and consuming APIs, some of which include:

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- Widely adopted API architecture.
- Characteristics include not storing session state between requests, caching capabilities, and support for various data types.

### GraphQL
- A query language for APIs.
- Provides a more flexible and efficient approach to data querying.

### WebSockets
- Enables bidirectional communication between client and server.
- Suitable for real-time applications.

### Webhooks
- Mechanism for automatically notifying other systems when certain events occur.
- Enables integration between different systems in a decoupled manner.

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- Protocol for exchanging structured information.
- Used for communication between applications over a network.

### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
- High-performance RPC framework.
- Facilitates communication between distributed systems.

### MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)
- Lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.
- Suitable for IoT applications.

# Access

APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them:

### Public APIs (aka Open APIs)
- Consumed by anyone who discovers the API.

### Private APIs
- Consumed only within an organization and not made public.

### Partner APIs
- Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship.
