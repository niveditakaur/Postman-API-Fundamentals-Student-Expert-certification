# Variables in Postman (Continued)

## Introduction
- Variables in Postman are used to store values for reuse and to hide sensitive information like API keys.
- They help in keeping work DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and secure.

## Variable Scopes
- Postman allows setting variables at various scopes: global, collection, environment, data, and local.
- Variables are resolved based on the nearest and narrowest scope.
- If a variable is declared in multiple scopes, the value from the narrowest scope takes precedence.
  - Example: If both global and local variables with the same name exist, the local variable's value will be used during request execution.

## Collection Variables
- Collection variables reside at the collection level and are accessible anywhere within the collection.
- They provide a convenient way to share values across requests within the same collection.
