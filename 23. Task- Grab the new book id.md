# Task: Grab the new book id

## Setting and Getting Collection Variables
- `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", value)`: Use this method to set a collection variable with a given name and value.
- `pm.collectionVariables.get("variableName")`: Use this method to retrieve the value of a collection variable by specifying its name.

## Local Variables in JavaScript
- `const`: Used for variables whose values won't change.
- `let`: Allows reassigning the value of a variable.

### Example:
```javascript
// Defining variables with const
const myVar = "This variable can't be reassigned";
console.log(myVar); // Output: This variable can't be reassigned

// Attempting to reassign the value of myVar
myVar = "foo"; 
// Output: [ERROR!] Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// Defining variables with let
let myVar2 = "I can change!";
console.log(myVar2); // Output: I can change!

myVar2 = "See, I changed!";
console.log(myVar2); // Output: See, I changed!
```

## Set the New Book ID as a Variable
- In the Body tab of the "add a book" request, update the book details to add a new book.
- In the Tests tab of the "add a book" request, replace the console.log() statement with the provided code snippet to save the value of the "id" from the API JSON response as a collection variable named "id".

### Example:
```javascript
// Save the value of the "id" from the API JSON response to a const variable named "id"
const id = pm.response.json().id;

// Set the value of the "id" variable to a collection variable named "id"
pm.collectionVariables.set("id", id);
```

- Note: If there is no existing collection variable named "id," Postman will create a new variable named "id" and assign the value accordingly.

## Viewing Collection Variables
- After sending the request, view the collection variables by clicking on the Postman Library API v2 collection and then selecting the Variables tab.
- The variable "id" will be automatically assigned the id of the new book as its current value, ready to be used in subsequent requests.

## Usage
- Use {{id}} anywhere in the collection to access the value of the new book id, facilitating further requests.
